# Transportation Ridership Forecasting - Kovai.co Assessment

## üìå Project Overview

This project implements a **Vector Autoregression (VAR)** model for forecasting transportation ridership across multiple service categories. The solution was developed as part of the **Kovai.co technical assessment** to demonstrate time series forecasting capabilities for multivariate transportation data.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

Predict **daily ridership for the next 7 days** across five transportation service categories:

- **Local Route** (bus services)  
- **Light Rail**  
- **Peak Service** (rush hour services)  
- **Rapid Route** (express services)  
- **School** (educational transport)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Approach

### Algorithm Selection: **Vector Autoregression (VAR)**

#### Why VAR?

- Captures **interdependencies** between different transportation modes  
- Generates **simultaneous forecasts** for all service categories  
- Accounts for **cross-variable relationships**  
  (e.g., high bus ridership may correlate with high rail usage)
